        <p class="text">In early 2016, I had an idea. A social network to take on the likes of Facebook and Instagram. (<a href="https://limegorilla.github.io/thearchive/blogs/the-echo-of-the-plus.html">lets not even mention Google+</a>) I developed it quite exponentially, eventually having logos, designs and more importantly, a name. <em>ZapNet</em><br>Suffice to say, it never came to frituition. But what it did do is introduce me to the world of not only websites, but development. This is what has come of it. "LimeGorilla." A name I both love and hate - love because it is notable, unique and quirky. Hate because it restricts me to one color (which by the background of this webpage, I have completely broken so that isn't that much of an issue) But that is not the point. LimeGorilla is my representation on the Internet. My digital personality. And this is it's home. A combination of my best coding, a dash of HTML, CSS, Java, and a blend of design. This is the home of my internet personality. This is the home of my projects. This is the home of the Gorilla, and you are all invited. Come on in!</p>
