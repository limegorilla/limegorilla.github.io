            <p class="text">Jheeeeeez this site has been a mess. Now its done. Hopefully.<br>Welcome to my site! My name is Liam Doyle (you may have guessed that. Just maybe.) and I am a "creative induvidual" - apparently. That name puts a label on my indesisiveness when it comes to what I want to do in life, so insted of sticking to one thing, I stick to as many things as I can.<br><br>That was a really bad analogy.<br><br>However, what I am is a developer, photographer, videographer. I make short films, apps, websites, operating systems, and I also do graphic design. I try to put my craft at whatever I do. I have done many many things in my short life and this website hosts as many of them as I can.</p>

            <h1 class="sub"><em>"liam doyle, a history."</em></h1>
            <p class="text">So, me. Who am I? Good question.<br><br>I was born in Chichester hospital on the 27th of Febuary 2003. I lived in England for several years where I broke a number of computers and my passion for technology started to grow. It wasn't until I moved to the canary islands in 2013 however until my real passion for tech came through. I started off with the basics and from there my repertoire of knowlage grew. Eventually I started this, in the summer of 2016. I am not going to lie, I copied things I saw from other websites and just "bodged" it together. I then bothered to not only learn HTML & CSS, as well as Python, C+ and Java. And because of that I am who I am today, even though that line sounds incredibly cringe.</p>
